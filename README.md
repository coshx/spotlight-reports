# Spotlight Reports

Spotlight Reports is a tool provider for Instructure's [Canvas](https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms) Learning Mangagement System.

It offers a way to view stats about the instructors within a sub-account.

## Development

### Step 1
To work on this project you will need an instance of Canvas running and API access to that instance. 
* [View the repo for instructions on running Canvas.](https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms)
* [How do I obtain an API access token?](http://guides.instructure.com/m/4214/l/40399-how-do-i-obtain-an-api-access-token)

### Step 2
Clone this repo and set up your credentials. To do so, create a file called `canvas.yml` in the `/config` folder. It should contain the following:

```
development:
  OAUTH_KEY: <generate one of these yourself>
  OAUTH_SECRET: <generate one of these yourself>
  API_URL: <this is the link to your canvas instance API>
  API_TOKEN: <this is the token you got when you set up API access>
production:
  OAUTH_KEY:
  OAUTH_SECRET: 
  API_URL: 
  API_TOKEN: 
```

### Step 3
Start the app. 
```
bundle install
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rails s
```

### Step 4
Install the app add-on into your Canvas instance. 

**Note:** If your Canvas instance is not running locally, you will need to expose the port on which you are running Spotlight Reports to the internet. [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) is a good solution for this.

In your Canvas instance do the following:
* Go to your Managed Accounts
* Click Settings in the left-hand nav
* Click the Apps tab
* Click View App Configurations
* Click Add App
* In the Configuration Type drop down, select "By URL"
* Type in the name: Spotlight Reports
* Paste in the Consumer key and Shared Secret that you created for canvas.yml
* Paste the URL for the Configuration XML. For example: "https://localhost:3000/config_xml" or "https://******.ngrok.com/config_xml"
* Click Submit

You should be told the app was successfully added. Refresh the page again and you will see "Spotlight Reports" added to the left-hand nav.

### Step 5
Populate your database
```
rake populate_database
```

Once all those steps are done, you should be able to go to a sub-account, click Spotlight Reports, and see a list of teachers with published courses.

## Deployment
You can deploy this on Heroku pretty easily. Just add the contents of `canvas.yml` as environment variables. Run the `populate_database` task upon initial deployment and use Heroku Scheduler to run `update_database` each night.
